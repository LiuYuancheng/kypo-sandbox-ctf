# Cybersecurity game "Junior hacker training"

This cybersecurity game allows a **hands-on demonstration and practice** of topics such as network scanning, SSH connections, and password cracking. It is suitable for undergraduate students in computing.

Please follow the [general instructions](https://gitlab.ics.muni.cz/muni-kypo-trainings/games/all-games-index) to set up the game, learn more about its [licensing](https://gitlab.ics.muni.cz/muni-kypo-trainings/games/all-games-index#license), and see how to [cite it](https://gitlab.ics.muni.cz/muni-kypo-trainings/games/all-games-index#how-to-cite-the-games).

***Note:*** On the attacker machine (kali), the *Open console (deprecated)* and *Open console* connection options do not work anymore. Only the preferred options (*Open GUI* and *SSH access* with external client) work.
